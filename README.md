# DIGITAL CHESS CLOCK 1.0 WITH NOTEPAD
The functionality of the program seems simpler to me, (Somewhat similar to ‘The Stopwatch by Catur Surya‘) and then we decided to take it as a next project. We made this program in One day, but all the other phases (except coding) designing, functions, etc. consumed some extra days. The **interface design** and the startup animation are all created using **‘batbox’** plugin of the batch.

# FEATURES – HOW IT IS MADE?
The UI of this **chess clock program** uses the plugin **‘CmdMenuSel’**. It is an awesome **900 KB** batch plugin, which allows users to generate a **static menu** list, from which the user can select one of the options using MOUSE or KEYBOARD. The plugin is created in Cpp.

It is a recommendation from #TheBATeam that you should use the mouse more while interacting with this program. Some of its phases require Only Mouse interaction (e.g. Quick Games option).

The help menu shown above may help you in some ways. But, if you are still in doubt, you may ask your query below in the comment field. The **3D text** shown above is printed only by using 2 times calling a simple batch function named **‘The Typography function 1.0‘**. And the options below contains individually the two options as ‘Player 1 time‘ and ‘Player 2 time‘.

If you want to play a custom time match and both the players will have the same time for thinking. Then you can simply **‘Set Time for Player 1‘** and **‘The time of player 2‘** will automatically be set according to that.

But, if both players want different time limits, then you simply have to **‘Set the time of player 2‘** after setting up a time for player 1. Notice that – the time of player 1 will affect the setting of player 2, but not vice versa. It may be a little confusing, Once you will get your hands on the program! Try to explore, the Program on your own!

As you can see easily, the main timer screen has a footer telling about all the possible key-presses which will help you in controlling the various situations of the chess clock program. E.g: You have, ‘P‘ for the **‘Pausing‘** the timer of both players, ‘S‘ for **‘Stopping‘** time of both players, etc.
